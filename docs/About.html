              Radin Khodadadi is an Iranian filmmaker, photographer, and
              videographer based in Vancouver, currently studying film at Simon
              Fraser University. His work blends introspective storytelling with
              surreal themes and a fusion of modern and postmodern styles.
              Radin’s work is a canvas of introspection and exploration,
              enriched by his background in photography.

            <p>
              Having earned a high school diploma in cinema, Radin’s journey
              commenced with <a href="Death Angel.html">Death Angel (2021)</a>,
              a poignant exploration of existential themes. Drawing inspiration
              from Jean-Paul Sartre’s Nausea, the film juxtaposes existentialist
              beliefs with nihilism, portraying a young boy’s struggle with the
              ennui of everyday life and his confrontation with mortality. Death
              Angel received an honorable mention at the Bahardastan Festival of
              Tehran Fine Arts School.

                >In The Realm of Dreams (2022)</a
              >, created in collaboration with a classmate, ventures into dream
              logic and the subconscious. Influenced by avant-garde classics
              like At Land and Un Chien Andalou, the film invites viewers to
              navigate surreal landscapes and explore the fluid boundaries of
              perception. With
              <a href="Under The Influence.html">Under The Influence (2023)</a>,
              Radin pays homage to directors such as Jean-Luc Godard, Leos
              Carax, and John Cassavetes, crafting a work infused with
              postmodern sensibilities.

              <a href="Let's Go Away.html">Let’s Go Away (2024)</a> marks a
              personal and artistic milestone. Inspired by themes of longing and
              escape found in works like Moonrise Kingdom and Pierrot le Fou,
              this film layers magical realism onto a narrative shaped by
              Radin’s own immigration to Vancouver. It follows two partners,
              each isolated in their own thoughts yet connected by a haunting
              song and a surreal encounter with an unusual Uber driver,
              capturing the bittersweet terrain of separation and fleeting
              connection. Radin’s dual role as director and lead actor adds a
              deeply personal dimension to the film, which features Farsi songs
              by the underground folk band He and His Friends. Selected for
              screening at the Rise Film Festival and Vancouver International
              Youth Film Festival, Let’s Go Away demonstrates Radin’s ability to
              blend cultural richness with universal emotion.

              is a film letter to Jim Jarmusch, borrowing the setting and spirit
              of Coffee and Cigarettes. Radin and collaborators improvised as
              themselves—drinking coffee, smoking, and chatting—allowing the
              rhythms of real conversation to guide the film. What began as a
              casual moment turned reflective, with a wandering cat providing a
              natural structure that bookends the film. Shot in a single
              afternoon on a back porch, the film drifts between fiction and
              documentary, shaped by presence, mood, and admiration for
              Jarmusch’s cinematic vision.

              Gorg O Mish (Persian for twilight, literally “wolf and ewe”) is an
              experimental piece exploring perceived movement and composition
              through six years of photographic fragments. Inspired by the
              liminal moment between day and night where shapes blur and
              certainty falters, the film blends stop-motion photography with a
              rich archival collection. Sound design plays a key role,
              incorporating recordings of environmental vibrations and heavily
              manipulated samples from Portishead and Radiohead, creating a
              meditative, immersive soundscape. Themes of memory, migration,
              self-reflection, and the passage of time emerge intuitively,
              allowing the film to serve as a personal and open-ended document.
              Selected by the film faculty for consideration at the TIFF Student
              Showcase, Gorg O Mish received positive feedback from both
              audience and professors alike.

              Radin continues to explore the intersections of visual
              storytelling across film, photography, and videography, driven by
              a desire to capture the nuanced complexities of human experience.
              His work embraces ambiguity and invites viewers into intimate,
              often surreal worlds that reflect both personal and universal
              themes. As he advances in his creative journey, Radin remains
              committed to pushing boundaries and expanding his artistic voice
              through new projects and collaborations.
